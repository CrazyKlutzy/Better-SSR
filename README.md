What is Better SSR?
Better SSR) is a progressive idea for improving the quality and efficiency of reflections in Minecraft Preview.Better SSR examines reflections in a way that could be less realistic and efficient.

Objectives of Better SSR

The Better SSR project aims to overcome these limitations by implementing a series of improvements and adjustments focused on:

Higher Distance Reflections: Improving the quality of renders for reflections, enabling faraway objects to be reflected to give a more realistic world environment.You no longer have to see reflections from a position that is almost within the block, all that you need to do is to position your camera appropriately that you can see reflections. SSR focuses on representing reflections in a more realistic and effective manner.

Objectives of Better SSR

The Better SSR project aims to overcome these limitations by implementing a series of improvements and adjustments focused on:

Higher Distance Reflections: Enhancing the rendering distance of reflections, allowing distant objects to be reflected, creating a more cohesive and realistic sense of the environment.

Improved The Way That The Reflective Block Reflects: You no longer have  to stay almost in the block to see reflections, you just need to aim your camera correctly that you will see the reflections.

How Does Better SSR Work?

Better SSR works using modified reflection_configuration_7 JSON, which contributes to the enhanced quality of reflections as well as their degree of reflecting.

Future of the Project

Better SSR still in progress, what i pretend to do is modify the horrible minecraft SSR and add one that eliminates fading and also add a way to make the blocks always reflect(without having to look at specific views just to see reflections) if possible, i will make this project more alive in 3 months(not sure) if minecraft dont make the ssr better then i will make it.
